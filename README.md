# TCP-Congestion-In-Legacy-and-SDN-Network
## Introduction
I would like to compare the throughput in a legacy and SDN networks using 3 different TCP congestion algorithms: TCP New-reno , TCP Vegas. and TCP Westwood.

I used a simulation software called Network Simulator 2 to simulate a legacy network, while for the SDN network, I used Mininet to emulate the network and Onos as its controller.
