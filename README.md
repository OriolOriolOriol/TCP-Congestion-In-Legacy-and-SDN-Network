# TCP-Congestion-In-Legacy-and-SDN-Network

I would like to compare the throughput in a legacy and SDN networks using 3 different TCP congestion algorithms: TCP New-reno , TCP Vegas. and TCP Westwood.

To create the legacy network I will use a simulation software called Network Simulator 2, while for the SDN network I will use Mininet to emulate the network and Onos as its controller.
